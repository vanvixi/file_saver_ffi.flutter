## 0.9.1

- Update `jni` dependency to `1.0.0`
- Update `jnigen` dev dependency to `0.16.0`

## 0.9.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed exceptions and locations:**
  - `UserSelectedLocation` has been renamed to `PickedDirectoryLocation`.
  - `WebSelectedLocation` has been renamed to `WebPickedDirectoryLocation`.
  - `PlatformException` has been renamed to `NativePlatformException` to avoid conflict with the `PlatformException` from the Flutter SDK.

### Added

- **Stream-based incremental file writing**:
  - `FileSaver.openWrite(SaveInput)`: Opens a file for incremental writing and returns a `FileSaverSink`.
  - `FileSaver.openWriteAs(SaveInput)`: Opens a file for incremental writing via system directory picker and returns a `FileSaverSink`.
- **Custom path support**:
  - `PathLocation`: Allows saving files directly to specific filesystem directory paths.
- **`file://` URI support**:
  - `FileSaver.canOpenFile(Uri)` and `FileSaver.openFile(Uri)` now support `file://` URIs.

## 0.8.3

### Added

- **`FileSaver.canOpenFile(Uri)`** — Checks whether the file at [uri] is accessible for reading.
  - Supported on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  - Not supported on Web.

## 0.8.2

### Added

- **`FileSaver.openFile(Uri)`** — opens a saved file with the system viewer.
  - Supported on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  - Not supported on Web (files are already handled by the browser download mechanism).

## 0.8.1

### Fixed

- **Android: Fatal crash on startup** (SIGSEGV in `FindClassUnchecked`)
  - The native `FileSaver` JNI object was eagerly constructed during plugin registration
    (`registerWith()`), before `JniPlugin` had a chance to set up the JVM context in
    `libdartjni.so`. This caused a null-pointer dereference inside `FindClass`.

## 0.8.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Static API**: `FileSaver` no longer requires an instance. All methods are now static.
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.saveBytes(...)` → After: `FileSaver.saveBytes(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.saveFile(...)` → After: `FileSaver.saveFile(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.saveNetwork(...)` → After: `FileSaver.saveNetwork(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.save(...)` → After: `FileSaver.save(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.saveAs(...)` → After: `FileSaver.saveAs(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.pickDirectory(...)` → After: `FileSaver.pickDirectory(...)`
  - Before: `FileSaver.instance.dispose()` → After: removed (no longer needed)

### Removed

The following methods have been removed. Use `save()` / `saveAsync()` with a `SaveInput` instead:

- `saveBytes()` → `save(input: SaveInput.bytes(...))`
- `saveBytesAsync()` → `saveAsync(input: SaveInput.bytes(...))`
- `saveFile()` → `save(input: SaveInput.file(...))`
- `saveFileAsync()` → `saveAsync(input: SaveInput.file(...))`
- `saveNetwork()` → `save(input: SaveInput.network(...))`
- `saveNetworkAsync()` → `saveAsync(input: SaveInput.network(...))`
- `dispose()` → removed (resources are managed automatically)

## 0.7.0

### Added

- **Web Support**: Full file saving support on Flutter Web

### Fixed

- **Desktop `saveNetwork`**: Added per-chunk idle timer — previously only the connection timeout was enforced; a stalled download would hang indefinitely after the connection was established

## 0.6.0

### Added

- **Linux Support**: Full file saving support on Linux — no native plugin code required
  - Directory resolution via XDG Base Directory Specification (`xdg-user-dirs`)
  - Supports all standard locations: `downloads`, `pictures`, `videos`, `music`, `documents`
  - Falls back to `~/Downloads` if XDG variable is not configured

### Refactored

- **`DesktopFileSaver` shared base class**: Extracted all common I/O logic (Windows + Linux)
  into an abstract `DesktopFileSaver` class. Each platform only implements `resolveDirectory()`.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **Windows Support**: Full file saving support on Windows — no native C++ plugin code required

### Refactored

- **`FileSaverPlatform` is now a pure interface** — removed circular imports between the platform interface and
  platform implementations. Platform initialization is handled uniformly in `FileSaver._()` for all platforms.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **macOS Support**: Save files to macOS directories using FFI with shared Darwin source code
- **Android: Automatic storage permission handling** for Android 9 and below

### Fixed

- **Network save: file deleted immediately after successful download**
  - `invalidateAndCancel()` triggered `didCompleteWithError` with cancellation error, which deleted the saved file
  - Replaced with `finishTasksAndInvalidate()` to allow the task to complete normally
  - Affected all platforms using native network save (`saveNetwork` / `saveNetworkAs`)
- **iOS: Network save to Photos requested permission after download**
  - Permission and conflict resolution are now checked before starting the download
  - Avoids wasting bandwidth if permission is denied or file already exists (skip/fail)

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- **iOS: Photos Library crash on iOS 14+ with add-only permission** (`PHPhotosErrorDomain error 3311`)
  - Previously requested `.addOnly` permission but incorrectly treated it as having read access
  - This caused crashes when attempting album creation or conflict resolution without read permission
  - Now requests the appropriate permission level based on usage:
    - With `subDir` (album name): requests `.readWrite` for album & conflict resolution support
    - Without `subDir`: requests `.addOnly` for basic save

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed `InvalidFileException` to `InvalidInputException`**
  - Error code changed from `INVALID_FILE` to `INVALID_INPUT`
  - This aligns error codes between iOS and Android platforms
  - Migration: Replace `InvalidFileException` with `InvalidInputException` in your catch blocks

### Added

- **User-Selected Directory Support**:
  - `pickDirectory()`: Show system directory picker (Android SAF / iOS Document Picker)
  - `saveAs()`: Stream-based API to save to user-selected directory using `SaveInput`
  - `saveAsync()`: Async wrapper for [saveAs] with optional progress callback.
- **Save Locations Update**: Add UserSelectedLocation for User-selected directory location

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Network Save Support**:
  - `saveNetwork()`: Stream-based API to download and save files directly from URLs
  - `saveNetworkAsync()`: Future-based API for network downloads with optional progress callback
  - Native optimization: Downloads directly to storage to avoid double storage (memory + disk)
  - Supports custom HTTP headers and timeouts

- **Unified API Entrypoints**:
  - `save()`: Single stream-based entrypoint using `SaveInput` sealed class (`SaveBytesInput`, `SaveFileInput`,
    `SaveNetworkInput`)
  - `saveAsync()`: Single future-based entrypoint using `SaveInput`
  - Allows polymorphic usage: `FileSaver.instance.save(input: SaveNetworkInput(...))`

### Refactored

- Source code refactoring

## 0.1.1

### Documentation

- **Save Locations Update**: Split table into separate `AndroidSaveLocation` and `IosSaveLocation` sections to clarify
  distinct enums

## 0.1.0

### Breaking Changes

- **`saveBytes()` now returns `Stream<SaveProgress>`** instead of `Future<Uri>`
  - Renamed `saveBytes` parameter from `bytes` to `fileBytes`.
  - Renamed `saveBytesAsync` parameter from `bytes` to `fileBytes`.

### Added

- **`saveFile()` method**: Save files from source path instead of bytes in memory
  - Stream-based API returning `Stream<SaveProgress>` for real-time progress tracking
  - Handles large files efficiently without loading entire file into RAM
  - Supports `file://` paths and picker results

- **`saveFileAsync()` method**: Convenience API returning `Future<Uri>` with optional `onProgress` callback

  ```dart
  final uri = await FileSaver.instance.saveFileAsync(
    filePath: '/path/to/source/video.mp4',
    fileName: 'my_video',
    fileType: VideoType.mp4,
    onProgress: (progress) => print('${(progress * 100).toInt()}%'),
  );
  ```

- **True Cancellation Support**: Cancel save operations mid-stream with proper cleanup
  - Call `subscription.cancel()` or break from `await for` loop to cancel
  - Native code stops I/O operations between chunks (1MB)
  - Partial files are automatically deleted on cancellation
  - `SaveProgressCancelled` event emitted on successful cancellation
  - Works for both `saveBytes()` and `saveFile()` streams

  ```dart
  // Example: Cancel with subscription
  final subscription = FileSaver.instance.saveBytes(...).listen((event) {
    if (event is SaveProgressCancelled) {
      print('Cancelled and cleaned up!');
    }
  });

  // Cancel when needed
  await subscription.cancel();

  // Example: Cancel with await for
  await for (final event in FileSaver.instance.saveBytes(...)) {
    if (shouldCancel) break;  // Triggers native cancellation
    // handle event...
  }
  ```

- **iOS iCloud download progress**: When saving files from iCloud Drive, progress is split into 2 phases:
  - Phase 1 (0% → 50%): iCloud download progress
  - Phase 2 (50% → 100%): Copy to destination progress

- **New exceptions**:
  - `FileNotFoundException`: Source file not found
  - `ICloudDownloadException`: iCloud download failed or timed out (iOS only)

### Changed

- **Simplified FormatValidator**: Removed codec/encoder validation on both platforms
  - iOS: Removed AVAssetWriter and ImageIO validation
  - Android: Removed MediaCodecList encoder checks
  - Now only validates MIME type category (image/video/audio)
  - Rationale: This library is a file saver, not a media player. Files are written as raw bytes without
    encoding/decoding. The developer is responsible for choosing appropriate formats.

### Fixed

- **iOS video filename**: Videos saved to Photos Library now preserve the specified filename instead of using UUID
- **iOS audio format crash**: Fixed crash when saving MP3 and other audio formats that AVAssetWriter doesn't support
- **Android audio format rejection**: Fixed rejection of audio formats not in MediaCodecList (AMR, OPUS, etc.)

## 0.0.5

### Breaking Changes

- **`saveBytes()` now returns `Stream<SaveProgress>`** instead of `Future<Uri>`
  - Enables real-time progress tracking during save operations
  - Use `saveBytesAsync()` for the previous `Future<Uri>` behavior

### Added

- **`SaveProgress` sealed class** for streaming progress events:
  - `SaveProgressStarted` - Operation started
  - `SaveProgressUpdate(double progress)` - Progress 0.0 to 1.0
  - `SaveProgressComplete(Uri uri)` - Success with file URI
  - `SaveProgressError(FileSaverException)` - Error occurred
  - `SaveProgressCancelled` - User cancelled
- **`saveBytesAsync()` method** - Convenience API returning `Future<Uri>` with optional `onProgress` callback
- **Real progress reporting for iOS** - Chunked file writes with progress callbacks (1MB chunks)

### Migration Guide

- To migrate from version 0.0.4 to 0.0.5, update your code as follows:

  ```dart
  // Before (0.0.4)
  final uri = await FileSaver.instance.saveBytes(...);

  // After (0.0.5) - Option 1: Use saveBytesAsync (minimal change)
  final uri = await FileSaver.instance.saveBytesAsync(...);

  // After (0.0.5) - Option 2: Use saveBytesAsync with progress
  final uri = await FileSaver.instance.saveBytesAsync(
    ...,
    onProgress: (progress) => print('${(progress * 100).toInt()}%'),
  );

  // After (0.0.5) - Option 3: Use saveBytes stream for full control
  await for (final event in FileSaver.instance.saveBytes(...)) {
    switch (event) {
      case SaveProgressStarted(): showLoading();
      case SaveProgressUpdate(:final progress): updateUI(progress);
      case SaveProgressComplete(:final uri): handleSuccess(uri);
      case SaveProgressError(:final exception): handleError(exception);
      case SaveProgressCancelled(): handleCancel();
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.0.4

### Added

- **SaveLocation Feature**: Explicit control over save locations with platform-specific enums
  - Android: `pictures`, `movies`, `music`, `downloads` (default), `dcim`
  - iOS: `photos` (Photos Library), `documents` (default, no permission)
  - Type-safe sealed class design with platform defaults

### Changed

- Added optional `saveLocation` parameter to `saveBytes()`
- Standardized parameter order: `saveLocation` now before `subDir`

### Breaking Changes

- **Default locations changed** for better UX:
  - Android: All files → Downloads (was type-based: Images→Pictures, Videos→Movies, etc.)
  - iOS: All files → Documents (was Images/Videos→Photos Library)
- **Migration**: Explicitly set `saveLocation` to maintain old behavior:
  ```dart
  saveLocation: Platform.isAndroid
    ? AndroidSaveLocation.pictures
    : [PlatformX]SaveLocation.photos
  ```

  - Android (Legacy): Delete existing file and save new one
  - Android 10+: Delete existing file via ContentResolver
  - iOS: Optimized with early return check
- **Platform Behavior Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for overwrite behavior
  - iOS Photos: Own files overwritten; other apps' files create duplicates
  - iOS Documents: Full overwrite capability (sandboxed per app)
  - Android 10+: Only detects/overwrites own files; other apps' files auto-renamed
  - Platform comparison table in README
- **iOS 14+ Dialog Prevention**: Added `PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert` key
  - Prevents automatic "Select More Photos" prompt on iOS 14+
  - Provides better user experience with limited photos access
  - Documented in README with setup instructions

### Refactored

- **iOS Code Quality**: Extracted common logic from ImageSaver and VideoSaver
  - Moved `findOrCreateAlbum()` to BaseFileSaver extension
  - Moved `handlePhotosConflictResolution()` to BaseFileSaver extension
  - Removed 38 lines of duplicated code for better maintainability

## 0.0.2

- Refactor `FileSaverIos` to use NativeFinalizer + Arena for safer native resource management, more robust, and less
  prone to native memory leaks while maintaining performance.
- Make `FileSaverPlatform.instance` a true singleton
- Update document and README.md
